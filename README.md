# FutureTask implementation
A simplified implementation of the FutureTask class based on the functionalities provided by Java's actual FutureTask
class. A Callable and Future interface have also been added for completeness.

## Sample output
```
Doing other work
Starting task
Doing other work
Doing other work
Doing other work
Doing other work
Task returned the value: Done
Starting task
Cancelling task
Terminating as thread was interrupted
```
